This program will assume that folder paths and sync interval will be defined with CLI each time
it is run. A configuration file would be a good update to the program if it is intended to be used
long-term.

I am also ignoring some helpful and time-saving external libraries (namely, Watchdog) in the
interest of not "cheating" on the assignment. The definition of what libraries are allowed feels
conservative, so I will be figuring this out the old-school way to the best of my ability.
